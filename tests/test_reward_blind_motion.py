"""Unit tests for p_blind, and for the absence of the r_bearing term it replaces.

Drives the real _reward_progress against a stub `self`, so the arithmetic under test is
the shipped arithmetic rather than a reimplementation that can drift. Distances are held
equal across steps so r_progress contributes exactly zero and p_blind is the only thing
moving.

The property that motivates the whole change is test_reward_is_yaw_sensitive: before
p_blind, no term could tell a drone facing its direction of travel from one flying the
same path sideways, because n and v were rotated by the same yaw-only vehicle quaternion
and the yaw cancelled in r_bearing's dot product.
